# Security Audit Report - Lancerscape2

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security audit of the Lancerscape2 platform, identifying vulnerabilities, implementing fixes, and establishing security best practices for production deployment.

## Security Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Issues Found:
- **Missing Authentication Middleware**: Routes were not properly protected
- **Weak JWT Configuration**: Long expiration times (24h) and weak secrets
- **No Rate Limiting**: Authentication endpoints vulnerable to brute force attacks
- **Missing Input Validation**: Direct use of request body without validation
- **Session Management**: No proper session tracking or blacklisting

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **Created Comprehensive Auth Middleware** (`backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`)
  - JWT token verification with proper issuer/audience validation
  - Redis-based session management and token blacklisting
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
  - Rate limiting for authenticated users
  - Suspicious activity logging and monitoring

- ✅ **Enhanced JWT Security** (`backend/src/config/index.ts`)
  - Reduced access token expiration from 24h to 15m
  - Enforced minimum secret length (32 characters) in production
  - Added proper issuer and audience claims
  - Implemented refresh token rotation

- ✅ **Input Validation & Sanitization** (`backend/src/utils/validation.ts`)
  - Comprehensive Joi schemas for all endpoints
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - HTML sanitization

- ✅ **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection** (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)
  - IP-based rate limiting for auth endpoints
  - Client ID-based rate limiting for authenticated users
  - Progressive slowdown for repeated violations
  - Separate limits for different operations

### 2. Database Security

#### Issues Found:
- **Connection Pool Vulnerabilities**: Insufficient timeout configurations
- **SQL Injection Risks**: Potential for parameter injection
- **No Query Logging**: Unable to monitor suspicious database activity
- **Weak Error Handling**: Database errors could expose sensitive information

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **Enhanced Database Security** (`backend/src/database/connection.ts`)
  - Increased connection timeouts for production environments
  - Added PostgreSQL session variables for security
  - Implemented query result sanitization (removes undefined values)
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Enhanced health checks with detailed pool status

- ✅ **Database Error Handling** (`backend/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`)
  - Sanitized error messages in production
  - Specific PostgreSQL error code handling
  - No sensitive information leakage
  - Request ID tracking for debugging

### 3. Smart Contract Security

#### Issues Found:
- **Reentrancy Vulnerabilities**: Potential for recursive calls
- **Integer Overflow**: No overflow protection for Solidity < 0.8.0
- **Access Control**: Insufficient role-based restrictions
- **Input Validation**: Limited validation of function parameters

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **Enhanced Smart Contract Security** (`contracts/Escrow.sol`)
  - Added ReentrancyGuard for all state-changing functions
  - Implemented proper access control with modifiers
  - Added input validation and bounds checking
  - Implemented emergency pause functionality
  - Added multi-signature support for critical operations
  - Enhanced event logging for audit trails
  - Added rate limiting and cooldown periods
  - Implemented proper cleanup for expired escrows

### 4. API Security

#### Issues Found:
- **Missing Security Headers**: No Helmet.js configuration
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: Overly permissive CORS settings
- **No Request Validation**: Missing request size limits and validation
- **Insufficient Logging**: Limited security event tracking

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **Enhanced API Security** (`backend/src/index.ts`)
  - Comprehensive Helmet.js configuration with CSP
  - Strict CORS policy with allowed origins
  - Request size limits and validation
  - Enhanced compression with security filters
  - Request ID tracking for all requests
  - Comprehensive security logging

### 5. File Upload Security

#### Issues Found:
- **No File Type Validation**: Potential for malicious file uploads
- **Missing Size Limits**: No maximum file size restrictions
- **No Virus Scanning**: Files not scanned for malware
- **Insecure Storage**: Direct file system access

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **File Upload Security** (`backend/src/utils/validation.ts`)
  - File type and MIME type validation
  - File size limits (10MB max)
  - Secure file naming and storage
  - Integration with AWS S3 for secure storage
  - Image processing and optimization with Sharp

### 6. Logging & Monitoring

#### Issues Found:
- **Insufficient Logging**: Limited security event tracking
- **No Log Rotation**: Logs could grow indefinitely
- **Missing Performance Monitoring**: No way to track system performance
- **No Security Alerts**: Suspicious activity not flagged

#### Fixes Implemented:
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging** (`backend/src/utils/logger.ts`)
  - Winston-based structured logging
  - Daily log rotation with compression
  - Separate log files for different concerns (error, performance, security)
  - Performance monitoring with high-resolution timing
  - Security event logging (login attempts, suspicious activity)
  - Database query logging for slow query detection
